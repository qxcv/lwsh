            <dt>What?</dt>
            <dd>
            The goal of the study hall is to reduce <a
                href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia">akrasia</a> through
            virtual <a
                href="//lesswrong.com/lw/gwo/coworking_collaboration_to_combat_akrasia/">
                co-working</a>. The study hall also has a synchronised <a
                href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro
                timer</a> to keep users on-task.
            </dd>

            <dt>I have a bug report/feature request/comment! Where can I put
            it?</dt>
            <dd>Bug reports and feature requests live over at the <a
                href="//github.com/qxcv/lwsh/issues">issue tracker</a>.
            Alternately, if you don't want to deal with Github, you can
            contact me by way of
            <a href="mailto:sam+lwshfeedback@qxcv.net">electronic mail</a>.

            <br>

            There are going to be a <em>lot</em> of bugs and missing features
            for now, so you may have to be patient waiting for a fix. Of course,
            if you're a programmer, you're always welcome to submit a <a
                href="//github.com/qxcv/lwsh/pulls">pull
                request</a> over at the old hub of gits.

            <dt>How do I start a pomodoro?</dt>
            <dd>If a pomodoro is not already running, you can just write
            &ldquo;:&lt;time&gt;&rdquo;. For example, if you wanted a 32
            minute pomodoro, you could write &ldquo;:32&rdquo;</dd>

            <dt>What if there IS a pomodoro running?</dt>
            <dd>I haven't figured out what I should do here yet. It probably
            needs some kind of voting system, but that's a lot of work
            :-)</dd>

            <dt>How about breaks?</dt>
            <dd>If a pomdoro has ended, you can start the break by saying
            &ldquo;ding&rdquo;.</dd>

            <dt>Mine webcamme worketh not! What foul &#383;orcery is thi&#383;?</dt>
            <dd>At the moment, recording is done with some new HTML5 media
            APIs that aren't supported on all browsers. I plan to fix this
            soon by adding support for the quirks of other browsers and/or
            using a Flash fallback. In the mean time, any recent copy of
            Firefox or Chrome should work.</dd>
